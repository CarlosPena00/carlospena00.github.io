title: "SQL Postgres: TL;DR"

I recently read the PostgreSQL book/tutorial [A Curious Moon](https://bigmachine.io/products/a-curious-moon/). And I decided to do a TL;DR (similar to the previous post about Oracle SQL), although this time focused on the teachings of the book.

The TLDR as well as the code used can be found in the repository: [tldr_a_curious_moon](https://github.com/CarlosPena00/tldr_a_curious_moon).
